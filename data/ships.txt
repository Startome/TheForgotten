	description "Like everything else in the New Systems, The Ranger is designed for maximum cost effectiveness. This fighter serves as a long range mobile defense platform. They are often seeded around a planet’s orbit to defend the system from attack, and on the offensive they can be deployed from carriers to quickly add a lot of firepower to an engagement. Small battles have been won or lost based on a commander’s ability to wisely use these platforms."

	description "The attack fighter frame is designed to fill multiple roles. In the case of the Halberd it carries a single piecing weapon designed to weaken larger foes before friendly combat ships enter engagement range. Most Halberd pilots rate themselves on how many times their escape pod has been recovered in battle as a mark of honor, instead of ‘kills’ as is traditional among fighter crews."

	description "The Galleon is named such because it is an extremely large and lumbering trade vessel. While it is slow and heavy, it is extremely well armed and a formidable foe to attack, not to mention the complement of escorts such valuable targets usually have in tow. It is nicknamed the Marquis, as it is the most grand and noble of civilian vessels in the New Systems."

	description "The Tsunami Battleship is the largest production ship in the New Systems, and most battle groups are built around these powerful vessels. They are usually designed with small ship support in mind, and are usually bare of any missile protection. What they lack in self-defense, they more than make up for in aggressive power. Few ships can even withstand seconds of a Battleships attention, not to mention hope for victory. In any major battle, they are the primary target of the enemy navy."

	description "The Invincible class ships are prototypes in the New Systems that are just crossing over into active military service. They have the newest possible technologies implemented in all areas. Including the biggest engines, most shield projectors, most weapon hard points, and newest weapons which are too large to fit on any other vessels in use. It would take two or three of the next largest vessels to effectively battle just one of these capital ships. This monstrosity is so advanced that despite the incredible wealth amassed to build them, they are rigged to explode if enough intruders are detected onboard. The factions would rather suffer their loss than have such a power be obtained by their opponents at their expense."

	description "Mine-Layers often are stationed at planets to help defend the system and prevent raids by the other factions. However, their primary use has been to accompany a task force with much larger ships and lay mines around the battlefield, attempting to screen the larger ships and protect them from direct assault by smaller vessels and fighters. To this end they work quite well, as often a single mine can do substantial damage to a fighter, and prevent the capital ship from wasting its large weapons on smaller threats."

	description "’The bridge of a Fast Attack Ship is anything but roomy or comfortable’ - J. Allan. Most captains of these vessels are a unique sort; a type who has little fear, and a lot of patience. That is to keep them from going mad cramped into the tiny spaces in the interior of these vessels.  Originally designed to run messages and mail back and forth quickly between systems, they were promptly adopted for military use due to their speed and firepower being so great for their cost. These ships are usually very fast, and slow to turn. This makes them great for quick hitting, but fleeing before they can be shot in return."
