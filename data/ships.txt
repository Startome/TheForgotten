	description "Like everything else in the New Systems, The Ranger is designed for maximum cost effectiveness. This fighter serves as a long range mobile defense platform. They are often seeded around a planet’s orbit to defend the system from attack, and on the offensive they can be deployed from carriers to quickly add a lot of firepower to an engagement. Small battles have been won or lost based on a commander’s ability to wisely use these platforms."

	description "The attack fighter frame is designed to fill multiple roles. In the case of the Halberd it carries a single piecing weapon designed to weaken larger foes before friendly combat ships enter engagement range. Most Halberd pilots rate themselves on how many times their escape pod has been recovered in battle as a mark of honor, instead of ‘kills’ as is traditional among fighter crews."
